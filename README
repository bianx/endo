This is to start a project using coarse-grained particles such as
dissipative particle dynamics (DPD),
which models and simulates fusion/fission processes between virus/vesicles/cells.
For example, the fusion process when the virus enter the cell is
typicall named as endocytosis.

Therefore, the project is named as "Endo"  in brevity.
